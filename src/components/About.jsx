                        Proficient in a range of programming languages, including C/C++ and Python. I am well-versed in data structures,
                        algorithms, and problem-solving. I also have hands-on experience with web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS,
                        and TailwindCSS. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and database
                        management systems, which I'm eager to apply in real-world projects.I've applied my knowledge and skills to create various software projects.
                        These projects not only showcase my technical skills but also demonstrate my ability to work in collaborative teams and adapt to new challenges.
